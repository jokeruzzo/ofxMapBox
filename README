Mapbox for Openframeworks IOS

Still in development.

Wat is possible right now:

- top layer EaglView
- add custom MBTiles with offlineMap(string map)
- online maps onlineMap("URL") // tilemap server recommended.. see tilestream for your own map or use one of the examples provided by mapBox.
- rotation of map by user or manually (see example https://vimeo.com/70893088)
- add annotations
- add markers
- projected point conversion


Fixes:
  
- had some troubles with receiving tap gestures. You can receive taps by using gotMessage(ofMessage& msg)
